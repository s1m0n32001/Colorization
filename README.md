# CNN based image colorization
#### Simone Toso, Francesco Zane
We implemented two CNN-based approaches to image colorization, based on the minization of two different loss functions, described in the paper [Colorful Image Colorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08511) by Zhang et. al. Final report in "ProjectReport.pdf" and clean project notebook in "Colorization.html".
